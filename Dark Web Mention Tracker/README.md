# Dark Web Mention Tracker

Monitors clearnet sources (e.g., Pastebin, forums) or simulates dark web lookups for mentions of a keyword (e.g., a company name).

**Hireability:** Shows familiarity with tracking leaked data or chatter, a niche but growing OSINT skill.
**Vibe Coding Twist:** Use AI to simulate dark web-style parsing or prioritize results by relevance.
**Tools:** Python (requests, Tor network if you're advanced), but stick to legal, public sources for now.
