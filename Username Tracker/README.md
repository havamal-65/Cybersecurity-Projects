Takes a username and checks where it appears across platforms (e.g., Reddit, GitHub, forums) to build a digital footprint.

**Hireability:** Demonstrates cross-platform correlation, a technique used to track individuals or groups in OSINT and cybersecurity.
**Vibe Coding Twist:** Let AI suggest additional platforms to check or help parse results for patterns (e.g., same bio text).
**Tools:** Python (requests, asyncio for speed), or use existing OSINT tools like Sherlock as inspiration.
