# Domain Investigator

Takes a domain name and pulls WHOIS data, IP info, or linked sites to uncover ownership or hosting details.

**Hireability:** Domain analysis is critical for identifying phishing sites or malicious infrastructureâ€”huge in OSINT and cybersecurity.
**Vibe Coding Twist:** Let AI suggest follow-up queries (e.g., "Check subdomains next") or format the output into a report.
**Tools:** Python (whois, dns-python), or use APIs like VirusTotal for extra data.
